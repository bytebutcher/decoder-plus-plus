 # Decoder++

![Decoder++ Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebutcher/decoder-plus-plus/master/dpp/images/dpp.png)

An extensible application for penetration testers and software developers to decode/encode data into various formats. 

## Setup

```Decoder++``` can be either installed by using ```pip``` or by pulling the source from this repository: 
```bash
# Install using pip
pip3 install decoder-plus-plus
```

## Overview

This section provides you with an overview about the individual ways of interacting with ```Decoder++```.
 For additional usage information check out the ```Advanced Usage``` section.
 
### Graphical User Interface
If you prefer a graphical user interface to transform your data 
```Decoder++``` gives you two choices: a ```main-window-mode``` and a ```dialog-mode```.

While the ```main-window-mode``` supports tabbing, the ```dialog-mode``` has the ability to return the transformed content to ```stdout``` 
ready for further processing. This comes quite in handy if you want to call ```Decoder++``` from other tools 
like BurpSuite (check out the [BurpSuite Send-to extension](https://github.com/bytebutcher/burp-send-to)) or any other script
in which you want to add a graphical user interface for flexible transformation of any input.

### Command Line

If you don't want to startup a graphical user interface but still make use of the various transformation methods of 
```Decoder++``` you 
 can use the commandline mode:

```bash
$ dpp -e base64 -h sha1 "Hello, world!"
e52d74c6d046c390345ae4343406b99587f2af0d
```

## Advanced Usage

This section provides you with additional information about how the command line interface can be used.

### Command Line Interface

The commandline interface gives you easy access to all available codecs.

To list them you can use the ```-l``` argument. To narrow down your search the ```-l```
 argument accepts additional parameters which are used as filter:

```bash
$ dpp -l base enc

Codec                 Type
-----                 ----
base16                encoder
base32                encoder
base64                encoder

```
```Decoder++``` distinguishes between encoders, decoders, hashers and scripts.
Like the graphical user interface the command line interface allows you to use multiple codecs in a row:
```bash
$ dpp "H4sIAAXmeVsC//NIzcnJ11Eozy/KSVEEAObG5usNAAAA" -d base64 -d gzip
Hello, world!
```

While encoders, decoders and hashers can be used right away, some of the scripts may require additional configuration.
To show all available options of a specific script you can add the ```help``` parameter:
```
$ dpp "Hello, world!" -s split_and_rejoin help

Split & Rejoin
==============

             Name  Value  Group            Required  Description
             ----  -----  -----            --------  -----------
   split_by_chars         split_behaviour  yes       the chars used at which to split the text
  split_by_length  0      split_behaviour  yes       the length used at which to split the text
rejoin_with_chars                          yes       the chars used to join the splitted text

```

To configure a specific script you need to supply the individual options as name-value pairs (e.g. ```search_term="Hello"```):

```
$ dpp "Hello, world!" -s search_and_replace search_term="Hello" replace_term="Hey"
Hey, world!
```

### Plugin Development

To add custom codecs just copy them into the ```$HOME/.config/dpp/plugins/``` folder. 

```python
from dpp.core.plugin.abstract_plugin import DecoderPlugin

class Plugin(DecoderPlugin):
    """
    Possible plugins are DecoderPlugin, EncoderPlugin, HasherPlugin, ScriptPlugin or IdentifyPlugin.
    See AbstractPlugin or it's implementations for more information.
    """ 

    def __init__(self, context):
        plugin_name = "URL"
        plugin_author = "Your Name"
        # Python Libraries which are required to be able to execute the run method of this plugin.
        plugin_requirements = ["urllib"]
        super().__init__(plugin_name, plugin_author, plugin_requirements, context)

    def run(self, text):
        # Load the required libraries here ...
        import urllib.parse
        # Run your action ...
        return urllib.parse.unquote(text)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Signals are not working on Mac OS

When starting ```Decoder++``` in Mac OS signals are not working.

This might happen when ```PyQt5``` is installed using homebrew. To fix this issue it is recommended to install the ```libdbus-1```
library. See http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/osx-issues.html#d-bus-and-macos for more information regarding this issue.  

### Can not start Decoder++ in Windows using CygWin

When starting ```Decoder++``` in ```CygWin``` an error occurs:
```
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
```

This happens although ```PyQt5``` is installed using pip. Currently there is no fix for that. Instead it is recommended
to start ```Decoder++``` using the Windows command line.

### No Module PyQt5.sig 

When starting ```Decoder++``` the error ```No module named 'PyQt5.sig'``` is displayed on the console. 
This may happen when there are competing versions of PyQt5 installed. Reinstalling PyQt5 should fix this error.

```
$ sudo pip3 uninstall PyQt5  
$ sudo pip3 install PyQt5
```
